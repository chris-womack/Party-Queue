#### Our Vision: 
Play music that everyone likes.

#### Automated Tests: 
###### Front end:
For frontend tests for the Android application, JUnit 4 was used to create unit tests. Tests are located in the directory Party-Queue/app/src/test/java/party_queue/myapplication, and can be run in Android Studio as shown in the below screenshot. 

See current unit tests for the frontend on this fork: https://github.com/busunkim96/Party-Queue/tree/master/app/src/test/java/party_queue/myapplication

* Expected command line output:

###### Back end:
Our backend is written in python2.x and hosted on google app engine. To run the tests, you will need to do the following:

1. Clone this repository
2. Make sure you have python installed.
2. Due to heavy integration of our backend with google app engine, you will need the [google app engine sdk](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads) to run the tests. 
3. After installaction, navigate to where you cloned the Party-Queue directory and change the system path insertions on lines 6-8 in models_test.py to:
```
sys.path.insert(1, '/path/to/google_appengine')
sys.path.insert(1, '/path/to/google_appengine/lib/yaml/lib')
sys.path.insert(1, '/path/to/Party-Queue/lib')
```
Replace `/path/to/google_appengine` with the path to where you installed the gae sdk, and replace `/path/to/Party-Queue/lib` with the path to where you cloned the Party-Queue directory.

Now, run `python models_test.py`. Ignore output lines like `WARNING:root:initial generator _put_tasklet(context.py:348) raised BadValueError(Entity has uninitialized properties: name)`. This is an artifact of unit testing with google app engine's models and is expected behavior.
