## CSCI 3308 Project: Party-Queue
A social party playlist. Users can vote on songs in a queue, and the songs are
played in the order of highest votes.

#### Description: 
Party Queue is a smartphone app that allows a group of people to create a queue of songs democratically. A main user will create a queue in which people can request to join. Once the master has approved them to join the queue they can push songs they would like to listen to onto the queue. Everyone who is in the group can see the songs that have been pushed and vote for which they would like to listen to next. The highest rated song will play next unless the master vetos the choice. The master will be able to see who pushed the song incase they favor a particular persons choices over others.    

#### Vision Statement: 
Play music that everyone likes.

#### Motivation: 
Choosing music with a large group of people can be nerve racking and you can receive quite a bit of grief from people. Not only this but people at parties will often bother whoever is playing music to play the song they want.  The app would allow people hosting to appease everyones musical desires democratically. It would also let whoever is hosting the party actively choose music at times but not be responsible at all times. 

#### Risks:
* Little experience with android studio or swift
* Using API from music apps could be hard
* Pushing broken code to master

#### Mitigation:
* Intro to Android studio book has been purchased
